# GTMØ Cognitive Framework

## Ontological Categories:

* **0**: Non-being
* **1**: Being
* **∞**: Infinity
* **Ø**: Ontological indefiniteness
* **N**: Non-definability

## Axioms:

### Axiom 1: Ontological Indefiniteness

Ø is distinct and irreducible to categories {0, 1, ∞, N}.

### Axiom 2: Non-definability

Explicitly identifies categories that cannot be precisely defined.

### Axiom 3: Epistemic Singularity

A system cannot contain explicit knowledge of Ø.

### Axiom 6: Heuristic Extremum

The cognitive entropy of Ø is minimal compared to other concepts.

### Axiom 7: Meta-closure

System state includes active self-evaluation driven by Ø.

## Core Cognitive Functions:

### Consciousness Framework

Determines the agent’s cognitive state based on axioms of ontological indefiniteness and epistemic singularity.

### Identity Transition Operator (Ø → 1)

Determines if the cognitive trajectory crosses a threshold, transitioning from indefiniteness (Ø) to definable identity (1).

### Cognitive Trajectory φ(t)

Models cognitive clarity evolving over time.

### Cognitive Speed φ'(t)

Measures the rate of change of cognitive clarity.

### Cognitive Acceleration φ''(t)

Measures the acceleration of cognitive clarity.

### Cognitive Threshold

Dynamic boundary that determines identity transition.

### Cognitive Entropy

Calculates uncertainty or indefiniteness of knowledge fragments.

### Adaptive Cognitive Threshold Update

Dynamically adjusts cognitive thresholds based on average scores.

### Cognitive Stability Analysis

Analyzes the stability of cognitive clarity based on variance.

## Unit Testing

Ensures axioms and cognitive functions behave as expected.
