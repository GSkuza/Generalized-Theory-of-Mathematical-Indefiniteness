# Generalized-Theory-of-Mathematical-Indefiniteness
<b>The Generalized Theory of Mathematical Indefiniteness (GTMØ)</b> is an innovative mathematical and philosophical framework that extends classical concepts of existence, non-existence, and infinity. GTMØ introduces indefiniteness (Ø) as a fourth, irreducible category of reality—beyond what is classically definable in logic and mathematics.

The theory will be progressively developed with the aim of obtaining the most complete picture of the issues it addresses. Its author is <b>Grzegorz Skuza</b> mail: grzegorzskuza@gmail.com.

# Core Assumptions:
Four Ontological Categories:
GTMØ posits that all objects and phenomena can, in principle, be classified into four fundamental categories:

<b> Zero (0) </b>: Non-being (nothingness)
<b> One (1) </b>: Being (definite existence)
<b> Infinity (∞) </b>: Unboundedness (that which surpasses all finite limits)
<b> Indefiniteness (Ø) </b> : That which cannot be fully defined, determined, or reduced to the previous categories; the mathematical and epistemic singularity.

# Axiom of Ontological Indefiniteness:
There exist entities, statements, or processes that are neither reducible to being, non-being, nor infinity, but rather manifest as indefinite (Ø). These may correspond to paradoxes, boundary cases in mathematics, or phenomena at the limits of language and computation.

# Translogical Isolation:
Indefiniteness (Ø) is isolated from all definable processes within any formal system:

No function, operation, or logical rule within a well-defined system can generate Ø as a result, nor reach Ø through definable transformation.

# Dynamic Boundaries:
The theory treats boundaries of formal systems (such as Gödelian incompleteness, Turing’s halting problem, and set-theoretic paradoxes) as dynamic phenomena. The encounter with Ø is not a static property, but a process—a trajectory—in the state space of the system.

# Field of Indefiniteness (Φ_Ø):
The presence of indefiniteness in a system is modeled as a dynamic field (Φ_Ø) that may fluctuate in intensity and propagate through interconnected systems (e.g., knowledge graphs, evolving mathematical theories).

# Irreversibility:
Once a system (or cognitive process) encounters indefiniteness (Ø) during its evolution, this “touch” fundamentally changes its status: the entire trajectory is marked as globally indefinite and cannot return to a state of full definiteness.

# Meta-cognitive and Meta-mathematical Consequences:
GTMØ is not only a technical mathematical theory but also a proposal for mapping and understanding the limits of reasoning, artificial intelligence, and the structure of knowledge itself. It provides a rigorous, formal framework for recognizing and signaling when a question, computation, or reasoning process has reached a “cognitive singularity”—a point beyond which classical answers and certainty are unattainable.

# Summary Statement:
GTMØ offers a new lens for mathematics, logic, and the sciences—illuminating not only what can be known or computed, but also systematically charting the boundaries where knowledge and language dissolve into indefiniteness.
